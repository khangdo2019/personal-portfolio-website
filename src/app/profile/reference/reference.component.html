                    <p>I had got chance to work with Khang for a short period of time, but his ability to think amazed me and moreover, he is a quick learner, he was so much adaptive to learn new technologies and new environments, communicating with everyone to understand business logic is mind-blowing.</p>
                    <p>I wish him good luck and I am sure he will be the best fit for any new technologies , challenges, and environments in his near future.</p>
