                <p> Khang Do worked under my supervision for last two months. In this period Khang has:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Successfully completed an extensive onboarding. Khang was very detailed and focused on approaching
                    training recommendation, consistently asked questions and followed up with the team.</li>
                  <li>Became an ambassador for Oxford and OMERS Coop program and demonstrated leadership skills in

                  <li>Completed development of PowerApps Phase 2 project. The project's goal was to fix numerous

                <p>I am thankful that Khang has joining our team in January and was able to provide so much value in
                  handling the application issues. In the second half of the term, Khang will start working on a new

                <p>Khang Do worked closely with me for the remainder of his co-op term. During this time, he has accomplished a lot and I can see the growth and confidence he has gained in such a short period of time. In the second half of his term, he was working on a big major project, our PowerBI Health Dashboard, in addition to enhancing our Azure Data Factory pipelines, and providing 3rd party platform support.</p> 
                <p>Khang also undertook the bulk of the work for the Azure Data Factory pipeline enhancements. He worked on unifying our 3 environments (DEV, UAT, PROD) to be the same, creating a dynamic pipeline solution for input/output validations to be re-used with our existing pipelines, and ensured all notifications are set to a distributed list address for easier notification management.</p>
                <p>Lastly, his eagerness to learn, his great attitude, and being a vocal participant in meetings has been a joy to our team. He always asked questions for clarity and direction, offered help by taking items on our list if he had capacity, and showed interest in joining in knowledge transfer sessions, learning RPA/Ui Path.</p> 
                <p>It feels like he has been with us for a long time. I am wishing Khang all the best in his future endeavors and hope we cross paths again. Keep up the great work, continue to learn and grow, and most of all continue to be you. It was a pleasure to work with you.</p>

                <p>I had got chance to work with Khang for a short period of time, but his ability to think amazed me
                  and moreover, he is a quick learner, he was so much adaptive to learn new technologies and new
                  environments, communicating with everyone to understand business logic is mind-blowing.</p>
                <p>I wish him good luck and I am sure he will be the best fit for any new technologies , challenges, and
                  environments in his near future.</p>
